Tic-tac-toe is s an old paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a four-by-four grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

There are a few differences with the classical one: • The board is square with 16 cells (4*4)

• Some cells will be randomly locked (no player can use these cells)

• The goal of Tic-Tac-Toe is to be one of the players to get three same symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally)

• Up to 2 players can play simultaneously. (For single player, the other player can be an AI). There are two options for players:

1- Human (Single player mode)

2- Computer (Two player mode)

For the option human (TP), both the players are human and for the option computer (SP), the first player is human and the second player is computer. Player 1 as 'X' and player 2 as 'O' enter their moves in each step.

• there are only three possible results:

1-player wins

2-his opponent (human or computer) wins

3-it’s a tie! (For equal or impossible score)
